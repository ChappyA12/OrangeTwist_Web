					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>
						Mary Asel and Andrea Roberson started Orange Twist in 2009. These
						friends and neighbors originally met at a kindergarten bus stop but really started to
						have fun when they discovered their complementary skills while partnering on a 
						fundraiser event.
						<br /><br />
						So began the "Where did you get that?" phenomenon. When Mary moved overseas, she 
						started scouring local markets to bring back gifts for friends. Andrea sensed a great
						opportunity. Together they set to work on building a business bringing pieces 
						state-side and into beautiful boutiques as unique and fun as the jewelry.
						<br /><br />
						Mary's and Andrea's experience in International Business Planning and media-related
						marketing, and their gratitude for the every day joys of life, with some bling on it
						of course, made for an exciting little jewelry company "that could."
						<br /><br />
						Today thanks to an outstanding group of sales reps, Orange Twist jewelry is sold a 
						wide variety of fabulous boutiques and fine museum stores around the corner and across
						the country.  We have also proudly designed pieces for sale in a number of catalogs.
